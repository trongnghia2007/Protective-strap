## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The strap is worn on the back, containing a **nylon inflatable airbag**.  
2. A **MPU6050 sensor** continuously monitors orientation and motion.  
3. When a fall is detected:
   - The microcontroller triggers a **mechanical puncture mechanism** to release air from a **compressed air cylinder**.  
   - The air inflates the back airbag to cushion the fall.  
4. Simultaneously:
   - A **buzzer alarm** activates to alert nearby people.  
   - A **SIM module** sends an emergency SMS/call to family members.
