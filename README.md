# 🛡️ Fall Prevention Strap for the Elderly

## 📌 Overview
The **Fall Prevention Strap** is a wearable prototype designed to protect elderly individuals from injuries caused by falls.  
It combines **fall detection**, **automatic airbag deployment**, and **emergency alerting** into one compact system.

## ⚙️ How It Works
1. The strap is worn on the back, containing a **nylon inflatable airbag**.  
2. A **MPU6050 sensor** continuously monitors orientation and motion.  
3. When a fall is detected:
   - The microcontroller triggers a **mechanical puncture mechanism** to release air from a **compressed air cylinder**.  
   - The air inflates the back airbag to cushion the fall.  
4. Simultaneously:
   - A **buzzer alarm** activates to alert nearby people.  
   - A **SIM module** sends an emergency SMS/call to family members.
